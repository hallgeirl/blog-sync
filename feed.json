				"content_html": "\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/IdentityServer\">IdentityServer</a> is quite an awesome framework for creating your own OAUTH-based authentication server in .NET Core. At its core, its purpose is to provide OAUTH endpoints to allow clients request access tokens to then call APIs. IdentityServer also <a href=\"https://docs.identityserver.io/en/dev/topics/federation_gateway.html\">supports being used as a federation gateway</a>, by utilizing the built-in authentication system in .NET Core.</p>\n\n<p>This is great if you&rsquo;re creating an authentication server that has a fixed number of authentication providers that serves applications that should use the same authentication providers, or a subset of these. However, in some scenarios, like the one I have in my own organization, where we allow customers to bring their own authentication, using OpenID Connect or WS Federation. We have a lot of customers on our cloud solution, so setting up each of the authentication providers statically in the authentication server is not going to work.</p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s some resources for this online, but it was hard to find concrete examples for how to achieve this. Here&rsquo;s a few tips that might be helpful if you&rsquo;re trying to achieve this in your application. I&rsquo;ll show the steps here for implementing federated OpenID Connect here, but the steps for adding support for WS Federation is more or less exactly the same (just swap out &ldquo;OpenIdConnect&rdquo; with &ldquo;WsFederation&rdquo; in most of the class names).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-setup\">The setup</h2>\n\n<p>We will define our authentication services in our ConfigureServices method:\n<pre>\nvar authBuilder = services.AddAuthentication();\nauthBuilder.Services.TryAddEnumerable(ServiceDescriptor.Singleton<IPostConfigureOptions<OpenIdConnectOptions>, OpenIdConnectPostConfigureOptions&gt;());\nauthBuilder.AddRemoteScheme<OpenIdConnectOptions, MultitenantOpenIdConnectHandler>(&ldquo;openid-connect&rdquo;, &ldquo;OpenID Connect&rdquo;, options =&gt;\n{\n    options.CallbackPath = &ldquo;/signin-oidc&rdquo;;\n});</p>\n\n<p>services.AddSingleton<IOptionsMonitor<OpenIdConnectOptions>, OpenIdConnectOptionsProvider&gt;();\nservices.AddSingleton<IConfigureOptions<OpenIdConnectOptions>, OpenIdConnectOptionsInitializer&gt;();\n</pre></p>\n\n<p>Notice that we don&rsquo;t just do AddOpenIdConnect() - we want to register a custom OpenIdConnectHandler that is multi-tenant aware. We&rsquo;ll get back to those details soon. Also notice that we register a custom IOptionsmonitor<OpenIdConnectOptions> and IConfigureOptions<OOpenIdConnectOptions> class. These will be used to fill in the client ID, authority and other parameters needed to authenticate at runtime.</p>\n\n<p>Then we&rsquo;ll configure the login URL for IdentityServer:\n<pre>\nservices.AddIdentityServer(options =&gt;\n{\n  options.UserInteraction.LoginUrl = &ldquo;/api/challenge/redirect&rdquo;;\n  options.UserInteraction.LoginReturnUrlParameter = &ldquo;returnUrl&rdquo;;\n})\n</pre>\nThe /api/challenge/redirect endpoint will resolve which authentication service to be used for a tenant, based on acr_values where we will add the tenant ID.</p>\n\n<p>Given all this, the authentication flow will be as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Initial page load</li>\n<li>Redirect to /connect/authorize?&hellip;</li>\n<li>Redirect to /api/challenge/redirect?returnUrl=&hellip; - this looks up the authentication scheme to be used (e.g. openid-connect or ws-federation based on tenant ID, which we send through acr_values).</li>\n<li>Redirect to /api/challenge?scheme=&hellip;&amp;returnUrl=&hellip;&amp;tenantId=&hellip;.</li>\n<li>Redirect to /api/challenge calls Challenge() with the specified scheme and returnUrl, which invokes the ASP.NET Core authentication mechanisms.</li>\n<li>Redirect to external auth provider.

This involves a lookup in a DB or something similar to get the ASP.NET Core authentication scheme for that tenant. We pass the tenant ID as in acr_values. More on that later.\n<pre>\n[HttpGet]\n[Route(&ldquo;redirect&rdquo;)]\npublic async Task<IActionResult> Redirect(string scheme, string returnUrl)\n{\n    var authContext = await _interaction.GetAuthorizationContextAsync(returnUrl);\n    var tenantId = authContext.Tenant;\n    // Look up the tenant&rsquo;s authentication provider here.

Note that you should validate the input here (return URL, etc.), but for brevity, I&rsquo;ve excluded this here. This is very standard, almost taken straight out of the quickstart UI for IdentityServer4.</p>\n\n<pre>\n[HttpGet]\n[Route(\"\")]\npublic async Task<IActionResult> Challenge(string scheme, string returnUrl, string tenantId)\n{\n    var props = new AuthenticationProperties\n    {\n        RedirectUri = \"/api/challenge/callback\",\n        Items =\n        {\n            { \"returnUrl\", returnUrl },\n            { \"scheme\", scheme },\n        }\n    };\n    return Challenge(props, scheme);\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p>Finally you have the challenge callback. I just use the same code as in the quickstart&rsquo;s Callback function, just adapted for using it in the API controller: <a href=\"https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4.Quickstart.UI/blob/main/Quickstart/Account/ExternalController.cs\">https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer4.Quickstart.UI/blob/main/Quickstart/Account/ExternalController.cs</a></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"serving-configuration-to-the-openidconnecthandler-at-runtime\">Serving configuration to the OpenIdConnectHandler at runtime</h2>\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, we have added a few singletons in our startup code:\n<pre>\nservices.AddSingleton<IOptionsMonitor<OpenIdConnectOptions>, OpenIdConnectOptionsProvider&gt;();\nservices.AddSingleton<IConfigureOptions<OpenIdConnectOptions>, OpenIdConnectOptionsInitializer&gt;();\n</pre>\nThe whole purpose of these are to serve configuration to the OpenIdConnectHandler at runtime.

This works great. One detail that is important to mention here is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Set options.CallbackPath to &ldquo;/signin-oidc/&rdquo; + tenantId; That way, after authentication, tenants are redirected to a tenant-specific endpoint.</li>\n<li>When there&rsquo;s no tenant ID, just set it to /signin-oidc. This happens on the first configuration call.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As for the tenant provider described in this StackOverflow post, for my usecase this doesn&rsquo;t work because not all URLs are prefixed with the tenant ID. Perhaps that could be done in IdentityServer - but I opted for a different solution. Here&rsquo;s the solution I went with for TenantProvider:</p>\n\n<pre>\npublic TenantAuthOptions GetCurrentTenant()\n{\n    var request = _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.Request;\n    string tenant = null;\n    PathString remainingPath;\n    if (request.Query.ContainsKey(\"tenantId\"))\n        tenant = request.Query[\"tenantId\"];\n    //OpenID Connect\n    else if (request.Path.StartsWithSegments(new PathString(\"/signin-oidc\"), StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase, out remainingPath))\n        tenant = remainingPath.Value.Trim('/');\n    //Do the DB lookup for the tenant authentication options (client ID, etc.)\n    return GetTenant(tenant);\n}\n</pre>\n\n<p>Here we look for the tenant ID in various places:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If it&rsquo;s set on the query string, we get it from there. That&rsquo;s needed when you redirect from /api/challenge/redirect to /api/challenge. You COULD probably add the tenant ID to the path on this endpoint instead. That&rsquo;s up to you, and then you wouldn&rsquo;t need to parse the query string.</li>\n<li>If we&rsquo;re at the signin-oidc endpoint, we get the tenant ID from the path.\n<br /></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-multi-tenant-openidconnecthandler\">The multi-tenant OpenIdConnectHandler</h2>\n\n<p>As mentioned previously, we can&rsquo;t use the built-in OpenIdConnectHandler in our usecase. The reason is (and I don&rsquo;t know WHY), is that some of the configuration options for the OpenIdConnectHandler is fetched per request, other values are cached seemingly forever after retrieving the configuration once. Most notably, the callback URL: If you use standard OpenIdConnectHandler, it will redirect correctly to /signin-oidc/(tenant-id), however, ShouldHandleRequestAsync() in the OpenIdConnectHandler() will return false, because apparently the CallbackPath is cached. Because of this, the handler won&rsquo;t handle the /signin-oidc/(tenant-id) requests, and you&rsquo;ll get a HTTP 404. I haven&rsquo;t looked into the details on WHY this is, but this is thankfully easily solvable:</p>\n\n<p><pre>\npublic class MultitenantOpenIdConnectHandler : OpenIdConnectHandler\n{\n  public MultitenantOpenIdConnectHandler(IOptionsMonitor<OpenIdConnectOptions> options, ILoggerFactory logger, HtmlEncoder htmlEncoder, UrlEncoder encoder, ISystemClock clock)\n      : base(options, logger, htmlEncoder, encoder, clock)\n  {\n  }\n  public override async Task<bool> ShouldHandleRequestAsync()\n  {\n      if (await base.ShouldHandleRequestAsync())\n          return true;\n      // We expect a path on the format: <callbackpath>/<tenant-id>\n      PathString remaining;\n      if (!Request.Path.StartsWithSegments(Options.CallbackPath, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase, out remaining))\n          return false;\n      // The remaining segment should only have one path segment (== the tenant)\n      return remaining.Value.Trim(&lsquo;/&rsquo;).Split(&lsquo;/&rsquo;).Length == 1;\n  }\n}\n</pre>\nIn other words, we just parse the request path, treating the CallbackPath as the base. The original code in the framework uses a simple equality check, which fails in this case.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"in-conclusion\">In conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>And this is pretty much it! I have based my implementation on the quickstart UI, so if you&rsquo;re new to IdentityServer I certainly advise you to start exploring that FIRST before attempting this crazyness right here.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this is of use to anyone.

				"title": "Digging up my old C++ game project",
				"content_html": "\n\n<p>I dug up some  of my old coding projects this weekend. Oh boy, there&rsquo;s lots of weird stufff I&rsquo;ve been making over the years, especially in my early youth. But there&rsquo;s some cool things as well. For instance, I made a Mario clone in C++ complete with a map editor and everything. Trying to get this project to compile were not simple 12 years later. Libraries were missing, were hard to find, and had moved on to newer versions. My environment has changed - back then I mostly used Linux, but for various reasons I now use Windows. With that I&rsquo;d like to reflect on a couple of topics that I came to think about during the process of getting my project up and running again.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-newer-c-standards-are-quite-awesome\">The newer C++ standards are quite awesome</h2>\n\n<p>Back in 2008, C++11, and certainly not C++17, were obviously not written yet. I had to rely on Boost libraries for things like smart pointers. There were no &ldquo;foreach&rdquo;-like syntax. Now, iterating arrays are just as easy as in other languages that include a foreach-syntax:</p>\n\n<p><pre>\nvector<string> foo;\nfoo.push_back(&ldquo;hi&rdquo;);\nfoo.push_back(&ldquo;there&rdquo;);\nfor (const auto&amp; val : foo)\n{\n    cout &lt;&lt; val &lt;&lt; endl;\n}\n</pre>\nThis seems super trivial today, where this kind of syntax is standard, and I would argue it&rsquo;s more or less expected from a language today to include this kind of syntax. Back in 2008 however, having most of my experienced in C++, this was not the case. Smart pointers are also a very welcome addition to the C++ standard family!</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, much functionality has been added to the standard libraries. To mention a couple that I&rsquo;ve started using now, are std::filesystem and std::chrono for directory traversal and frame timing in my game, respectively. I had to rely on boost for a lot of things, and timing functions were mostly platform specific.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"garbage-collection-i-don-t-miss-you\">Garbage collection? I don&rsquo;t miss you</h2>\n\n<p>In .NET, Java, Javascript and many other languages, you have a garbage collector running for you to ensure that objects you allocate on the heap are deallocated when no one are referencing them anymore. This is great - but it does have a performance cost. For large projects with a lot of object allocations, the garbage collection cycle can negatively impact performance.</p>\n\n<p>With C++, you have no garbage collector. You need to manage the heap yourself. If you have a &ldquo;new&rdquo;, you need a &ldquo;delete&rdquo;, or else you get a memory leak. However, a common best practice in C++ is to avoid dynamic memory allocations as much as you can, which significantly limits this problem, and in some cases even removes it completely. Instead, C++ objects are allocated on the stack. Objects on the stack gets deleted when the stack frame is &ldquo;done&rdquo;. For instance, local objects defined in a function are deallocated when the function returns (unless you allocate objects on the heap, which you shouldn&rsquo;t).</p>\n\n<p>So what&rsquo;s great about this? Well, the obvious one is that you no longer NEED a garbage collector. I find it strangely comforting to know exactly how long my objects live - and I don&rsquo;t need to hypothesize if the high memory usage of my application is because the garbage collector hasn&rsquo;t run yet, or if I actually have a memory leak.

But I wanted to find a proper cross-platform alternative - and that alternative is CMake.

				"content_text": "I dug up some  of my old coding projects this weekend. Oh boy, there's lots of weird stufff I've been making over the years, especially in my early youth. But there's some cool things as well. For instance, I made a Mario clone in C++ complete with a map editor and everything. Trying to get this project to compile were not simple 12 years later. Libraries were missing, were hard to find, and had moved on to newer versions. My environment has changed - back then I mostly used Linux, but for various reasons I now use Windows. With that I'd like to reflect on a couple of topics that I came to think about during the process of getting my project up and running again.\n\n## The newer C++ standards are quite awesome\nBack in 2008, C++11, and certainly not C++17, were obviously not written yet. I had to rely on Boost libraries for things like smart pointers. There were no \"foreach\"-like syntax. Now, iterating arrays are just as easy as in other languages that include a foreach-syntax:\n\n<pre>\nvector<string> foo;\nfoo.push_back(\"hi\");\nfoo.push_back(\"there\");\nfor (const auto& val : foo)\n{\n  \tcout << val << endl;\n}\n</pre>\nThis seems super trivial today, where this kind of syntax is standard, and I would argue it's more or less expected from a language today to include this kind of syntax. Back in 2008 however, having most of my experienced in C++, this was not the case. Smart pointers are also a very welcome addition to the C++ standard family!\n\nAdditionally, much functionality has been added to the standard libraries. To mention a couple that I've started using now, are std::filesystem and std::chrono for directory traversal and frame timing in my game, respectively. I had to rely on boost for a lot of things, and timing functions were mostly platform specific.\n\n## Garbage collection? I don't miss you\nIn .NET, Java, Javascript and many other languages, you have a garbage collector running for you to ensure that objects you allocate on the heap are deallocated when no one are referencing them anymore. This is great - but it does have a performance cost. For large projects with a lot of object allocations, the garbage collection cycle can negatively impact performance. \n\nWith C++, you have no garbage collector. You need to manage the heap yourself. If you have a \"new\", you need a \"delete\", or else you get a memory leak. However, a common best practice in C++ is to avoid dynamic memory allocations as much as you can, which significantly limits this problem, and in some cases even removes it completely. Instead, C++ objects are allocated on the stack. Objects on the stack gets deleted when the stack frame is \"done\". For instance, local objects defined in a function are deallocated when the function returns (unless you allocate objects on the heap, which you shouldn't). \n\nSo what's great about this? Well, the obvious one is that you no longer NEED a garbage collector. I find it strangely comforting to know exactly how long my objects live - and I don't need to hypothesize if the high memory usage of my application is because the garbage collector hasn't run yet, or if I actually have a memory leak. Stack allocation just is so comfortable. It's not perfect if you need heap-allocated objects, however. I will aim to get rid of most or all heap allocations though.\n\n## CMake\nI based my old game project on Makefiles. This is great - if you're running on Linux. But Makefiles haven't really been the \"standard\" on Windows. I'm sure you could use them somehow, though. But I wanted to find a proper cross-platform alternative - and that alternative is CMake. CMake is great - it's fully supported in Visual Studio, is cross-platform and, in my opinion, has a much cleaner syntax than Makefiles. Here's a minimal example:\n<pre>\ncmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.8)\n\nadd_executable (CMakeTest \"CMakeTest.cpp\")\n</pre>\nThis doens't do much of course, other than compiling CMakeTest.cpp into an executable CMakeTest. It's super simple to also add include paths and link paths to the target. \n\nCMake were around in 2008, but I was not aware of it, or perhaps didn't see the value. I'll be using CMake from now on. \n\n## Cross-platform is king\nPeople sometimes switch operating systems, for various reasons. I switched from Linux to Windows after I started working in my current organization, which is mainly a Windows shop. I also enjoy gaming, and back then gaming on Linux were not that mature (and it still has its issues). Anyway, I made my game project to be cross platform from the start using SDL.

Note that if you previously used a &ldquo;TargetFramework&rdquo; element, you need to change this to &ldquo;TargetFrameworks&rdquo; (plural): <pre>&lt;TargetFrameworks&gt;net48;netcoreapp3.1&lt;/TargetFrameworks&gt;</pre></li>\n<li>Sometimes you may need to have different code for .NET Core and .NET Framework. For instance, there may be libraries that should only be used for .NET Core, while you use framework assemblies in .NET Framework. In those cases, you can use <em>#if</em> directives to tell the compiler to compile that code only for specific frameworks. Example: <pre>#if NETFRAMEWORK<br />//.NET Framework-specific code here<br />#else<br />//.NET Core-specific code here<br />#endif</pre></li>\n<li>Related to the previous point - sometimes, there are NuGet packages, or assembly references, that only make sense for .NET Core, and some that only make sense to .NET Framework.

It&rsquo;s a different way of initializing the application, different classes that area used for controllers, no more HTTP modules, and the list goes on. Therefore, when porting ASP.NET code, what we decided was to split our ASP.NET project into three projects:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>One ASP.NET specific project, which contains the plumbing, lifecycle hooks for ASP.NET, HTTP modules and other .NET Framework specific constructs. This project targets only .NET Framework.</li>\n<li>One ASP.NET Core specific project, which contains the plumbing for ASP.NET Core (startup/configuration code, etc.), middleware, and other ASP.NET Core-specific code. This project only targets .NET Core.</li>\n<li>One project that contains all the application logic. This includes API controllers and all the logic that is defining your actual application. Add this project as a reference to the other two projects, and make sure this common project targets both .NET Core and .NET Framework.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first two projects is fairly straight forward. However, the common project needs some thought, because ASP.NET Core controllers are a completely different type from the ASP.NET controllers. Thankfully, there&rsquo;s a neat package: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.WebApiCompatShim. This allows you to re-use the typenames for ASP.NET controllers, and act as an adapter between ASP.NET Core &amp; ASP.NET and your controller definitions. So here&rsquo;s some steps you can take for this project:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Include the ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core packages conditionally, including the WebApiCompatShim package (which has the required ASP.NET Core packages as dependencies): <pre>&lt;ItemGroup Condition=&quot;$(TargetFramework.StartsWith(&#39;net4&#39;))&quot;&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.WebHost&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;\n&lt;ItemGroup Condition=&quot;!$(TargetFramework.StartsWith(&#39;net4&#39;))&quot;&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.WebApiCompatShim&quot; /&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;PackageReference Include=&quot;Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;</pre></li>\n<li>In the controller code, you need to have some conditional <em>#if</em> directives. First off, <em>RoutePrefix</em> is no longer a thing, but <em>Route</em> serves the same purpose when put on the controller level. You also need some conditional <em>using</em> statements:<pre>#if !NETFRAMEWORK\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\nusing RoutePrefixAttribute = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RouteAttribute;\n#endif</pre>This serves the purpose of: 1. Creating an alias for RoutePrefix with ASP.NET Core, and 2. Include the ASP.NET Core namespace.</li>\n<li>HttpContext.Current is no longer a thing as well - so you will have to make an adjustment for this. You can use dependency injection with ASP.NET Core, and a <em>#if</em> directive to instead use HttpContext.Current in .NET Framework.</li>\n<li>Keep the controller base class as before (ApiController). The WebApiCompatShim package defines ApiController for .NET Core.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As for HTTP modules, which is .NET Framework specific, these should be implemented as ASP.NET Core middleware. This is described elsewhere: <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/http-modules?view=aspnetcore-3.1\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/http-modules?view=aspnetcore-3.1</a></p>\n\n<p>Other than this, there should not be a lot of changes needed, apart from general porting of code.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"porting-workflow-foundation-and-windows-communication-foundation-code\">Porting Workflow Foundation and Windows Communication Foundation code</h2>\n\n<p>I won&rsquo;t write a lot here because I&rsquo;m not an authority when it comes to WF and WCF. However, I want to highlight two Nuget packages that can be used to ease the transition to .NET Core:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/UiPath-Open/corewf\">CoreWf</a> - for Workflow Foundation</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/DigDes/SoapCore\">SoapCore</a> - For WCF</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Both of these are available in the public nuget feed. Kudos to the authors of these packages for significantly easing the transition of legacy WF and WCF code.</p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s it for now!

You also need some conditional *using* statements:<pre>#if !NETFRAMEWORK\r\nusing Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;\r\nusing RoutePrefixAttribute = Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.RouteAttribute;\r\n#endif</pre>This serves the purpose of: 1. Creating an alias for RoutePrefix with ASP.NET Core, and 2. Include the ASP.NET Core namespace.\r\n* HttpContext.Current is no longer a thing as well - so you will have to make an adjustment for this. You can use dependency injection with ASP.NET Core, and a *#if* directive to instead use HttpContext.Current in .NET Framework.\r\n* Keep the controller base class as before (ApiController). The WebApiCompatShim package defines ApiController for .NET Core.\r\n\r\nAs for HTTP modules, which is .NET Framework specific, these should be implemented as ASP.NET Core middleware. This is described elsewhere: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/http-modules?view=aspnetcore-3.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/http-modules?view=aspnetcore-3.1)\r\n\r\nOther than this, there should not be a lot of changes needed, apart from general porting of code.\r\n\r\n## Porting Workflow Foundation and Windows Communication Foundation code\r\nI won't write a lot here because I'm not an authority when it comes to WF and WCF. However, I want to highlight two Nuget packages that can be used to ease the transition to .NET Core:\r\n\r\n* [CoreWf](https://github.com/UiPath-Open/corewf) - for Workflow Foundation\r\n* [SoapCore](https://github.com/DigDes/SoapCore) - For WCF\r\n\r\nBoth of these are available in the public nuget feed. Kudos to the authors of these packages for significantly easing the transition of legacy WF and WCF code.\r\n\r\nThat's it for now! You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hallgeirl) if you have any comments or feedback.\n",
